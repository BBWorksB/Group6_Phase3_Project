    "## Introduction:\n",
    "\n",
    "GNB Bank is a leading financial institution, providing various banking and financial services to its customers. As with any bank, customer retention is crucial for maintaining a strong market presence and sustaining profitability. Identifying customers who are likely to churn is of paramount importance for GNB Bank to implement targeted strategies and retain valuable customers. In this notebook, we will explore a dataset containing customer information, including demographics, banking behavior, and historical churn data. Our objective is to build a predictive model that can accurately predict customer churn and provide valuable insights to help GNB Bank enhance its customer retention efforts."

    "## Business Understanding:\n",
    "\n",
    "For GNB Bank, understanding and predicting customer churn is critical for several reasons. First and foremost, customer churn impacts the bank's revenue and profitability. Acquiring new customers is more expensive than retaining existing ones, so preventing churn can lead to significant cost savings. Moreover, customer retention contributes to a positive reputation and strengthens the bank's position in the highly competitive financial industry. By leveraging machine learning techniques to predict customer churn, GNB Bank can proactively address the needs of at-risk customers, personalize their banking experience, and develop targeted marketing campaigns to foster long-term customer loyalty."

    "## Problem Statement:\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this project is to build an accurate customer churn prediction model for GNB Bank. Specifically, we aim to develop a machine learning model that can predict whether a customer is likely to churn or not based on their historical behavior and demographic information. The project involves the following tasks:\n",
    "\n",
    "Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): We will explore the dataset to gain insights into customer demographics, banking behavior, and the distribution of churned customers. EDA will help us understand the data and identify patterns that may be indicative of churn.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data Preprocessing: We will handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and perform feature scaling to prepare the data for model training.\n",
    "\n",
    "Feature Importance Analysis: Using SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations), we will identify the most important features that influence customer churn for GNB Bank.\n",
    "\n",
    "Model Building: We will train and evaluate two machine learning models - Decision Trees and Random Forests - to predict customer churn accurately.\n",
    "\n",
    "Model Evaluation: The performance of the models will be assessed using various evaluation metrics, such as accuracy, F1 score, precision, recall, and the ROC-AUC curve.\n",
    "\n",
    "Interpretation and Recommendations: We will interpret the model results to identify key factors contributing to customer churn for GNB Bank. Based on the insights gained, we will provide actionable recommendations to the bank on strategies to reduce churn and improve customer retention.\n",
    "\n",
    "By completing these tasks, we aim to deliver a robust customer churn prediction model that will enable GNB Bank to make data-driven decisions, enhance customer satisfaction, and strengthen its market position in the competitive financial industry."
