# Customer Churn Prediction for GNB Bank

![Churn Prediction](image1.png)

## Overview

Welcome to the "Customer Churn Prediction for GNB Bank" project. In this endeavor, we delve into the crucial task of predicting customer churn for GNB Bank, a leading financial institution. Customer churn, the phenomenon of customers discontinuing their engagement with a service, has far-reaching implications for a bank's revenue, reputation, and market position. Our primary goal is to develop a robust predictive model that identifies customers at risk of churning, enabling GNB Bank to take proactive measures to retain these valuable customers.

## Business Understanding

Understanding customer churn's impact on GNB Bank's financial health is essential. By predicting churn, the bank can optimize resource allocation, enhance customer satisfaction, and foster long-term profitability.

## Data Exploration and Preprocessing

The dataset, comprising customer information and banking behavior, is explored. Data preprocessing encompasses cleaning, transforming, and preparing data for analysis. Missing values are addressed, and irrelevant features are pruned.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

EDA provides insights into the dataset's characteristics. The distribution of churn is visualized, uncovering patterns and trends. Correlations between features are examined, guiding modeling strategies.

## Modeling Strategies

Multiple machine learning algorithms are employed, justified by their relevance. Hyperparameters are fine-tuned for optimal performance. Imbalanced classes are tackled using the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE).

## Model Evaluation and Interpretation

The models' effectiveness is assessed using an array of evaluation metrics. SHAP values facilitate understanding feature importance, enhancing model interpretability. Interpretations inform strategic decisions.

## Recommendations for GNB Bank

The model's insights serve as a foundation for retention strategies. Personalized experiences, timely engagement, and targeted initiatives are recommended to enhance customer loyalty and mitigate churn.

## Conclusion and Future Directions

The project culminates in a predictive model tailored for GNB Bank's unique challenges. The derived insights empower the bank to enhance customer retention strategies continuously, adapting to changing dynamics.
